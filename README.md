# claritystack
ClarityStack operates on a **Hybrid Monolith** architecture. It uses a unified PHP backend to serve both a high-performance REST API and a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) marketing frontend. This structure ensures optimal SEO for public pages while maintaining a reactive Single Page Application (SPA) experience for the client and admin dashboards.
