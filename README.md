## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

ClarityStack utilizes a **Hybrid Monolith** architecture. It serves public marketing pages via Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for optimal SEO, while the Admin Dashboard and Client Portal run as a React Single Page Application (SPA).

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎨 Hybrid Theme Engine

* **Performance:** Public marketing pages (Home, Portfolio, Pricing) are server-side rendered (SSR) via PHP for 100/100 Lighthouse SEO scores.
* **Reactivity:** The Admin Dashboard and Client Portal operate as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React for a fluid user experience.
* **Recursive Block Builder:** A drag-and-drop page builder that allows nested layouts (e.g., Columns inside Containers) with a robust "Safety Net" that prevents white-screen crashes.
* **Secure Output:** Native HTML Sanitization strips malicious scripts while preserving rich text formatting.

### 📸 Secure Client Proofing

* **IDOR Protection:** High-resolution original files are stored **outside** the web root. Access is proxied via a secure PHP controller that verifies session ownership before streaming bytes.
* **Magic Links:** Passwordless authentication for clients via secure, time-bound email links.
* **Secure Downloads:** Large ZIP downloads are generated on-the-fly and streamed via signed, one-time-use URLs to prevent memory exhaustion and unauthorized sharing.
* **Storage Adapters:** Switch seamlessly between Local Disk, AWS S3, Cloudinary, ImageKit, or Google Drive via the Admin UI.

### 💰 Studio Management

* **Stripe Integration:** Automated booking flow with webhook verification (Signature & Idempotency checks).
* **EXIF Extraction:** Automatically extracts camera, lens, and exposure data from uploaded JPEGs for display.
* **Dynamic Watermarking:** (Optional) On-the-fly watermark injection for unpaid proofing galleries.
